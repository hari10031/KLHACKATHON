{"mismatches":[{"id":"FRAUD-010-ITCOVR","type":"ITC_OVERCLAIM","severity":"HIGH","description":"ITC claimed in GSTR-3B exceeds available credit in GSTR-2B by ₹8.92L","narrative":"Reliance Trading Corp claimed IGST ITC of ₹18,42,350 in November 2024 GSTR-3B, but the auto-populated GSTR-2B shows eligible ITC of only ₹9,50,000. The excess of ₹8,92,350 has no supporting documentation in the GSTR-2B. Analysis shows the buyer manually entered additional ITC of ₹8,92,350 under 'All other ITC' section of GSTR-3B Table 4(A)(5), which is meant only for ITC on imports, ISD credits, and transitional credits — none of which apply here. The buyer has a history of claiming excess ITC in 3 of the previous 5 months.","itc_risk":892350.0,"tax_difference":null,"risk_score":71.0,"evidence_path":"GSTR-3B Table 4(A)(5) 'All other ITC': ₹8,92,350 claimed without basis\nGSTR-2B total eligible ITC: ₹9,50,000\nGSTR-3B total ITC claimed: ₹18,42,350 (excess ₹8,92,350)\nRepeat offender: 3 of last 5 months show excess claims (Jul, Sep, Oct 2024)","resolution_actions":"Restrict ITC to GSTR-2B amount under Rule 36(4)\nIssue notice under Section 74 (fraud/wilful misstatement — extended period)\nImpose penalty of ₹8,92,350 under Section 122(2)(b)","regulatory_ref":"Rule 36(4) CGST Rules — ITC capped at GSTR-2B values\nSection 74 CGST Act — Determination of tax with fraud intent\nSection 122(2)(b) CGST Act — Penalty for claiming excess ITC","buyer_gstin":"05NZJPJ8685W7ZH","seller_gstin":"03QAHFE7680NZZM","return_period":"112024","invoice_value":null,"status":"OPEN"}],"total":1,"page":1,"page_size":50,"severity_counts":{"HIGH":1},"all_types":["ITC_OVERCLAIM"]}
